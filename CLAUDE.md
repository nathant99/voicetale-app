# VoiceTale

Voice-first oral storytelling workshop for tweens — 60-120 second told tales across a 5-beat arc (hook/setup/rising/turn/close), with on-device transcript-side AI reflection and a tradition layer that honors oral-storytelling lineages without appropriation.

**Status**: Pre-implementation scaffold. See @Docs/README.md for the labsmith concept doc + Phase 1 entry point. **Full Tier 2 doc set is pending**: TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, FEATURE_PLAN.md, CONTENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md, TESTING_STRATEGY.md, PERFORMANCE_BUDGET.md, KIDSAFE_PREPARATION.md, DOCUMENT_CATALOG.md (per `labsmith/Docs/PORTFOLIO_PATTERNS.md` Documentation Maturity Tier 2). Labsmith authors these in a future wave; this repo is bootstrap-only.

**Wave**: Wave 5 (writing-craft cluster) per `labsmith/Docs/PLAN_WRITING_CRAFT_CLUSTER.md` or related cluster plan.

**Hero color**: `#1B7B8C`
**Mascot**: Bramble (chunky-cartoon flat-vector, shipped at `Resources/Illustrations/mascots/bramble_encouraging.webp`).

## Tech Stack (portfolio standard)

- **Language**: Swift 6 (strict concurrency)
- **UI**: SwiftUI (menus, HUD, overlays)
- **Rendering**: SwiftUI + SpriteKit + SpriteView (gameplay surfaces). SceneKit prohibited (deprecated WWDC25)
- **AI Mentor**: FoundationModels (on-device, `@Generable` types)
- **Persistence**: SwiftData (`@Model`, `@Relationship`)
- **Minimum Target**: iOS 26
- **IDE**: Xcode 26
- **Testing**: Swift Testing framework (`@Test`, `#expect`)
- **No Combine**: Async/await only
- **Linting**: SwiftLint SUSPENDED (crashes on Xcode 26). Config retained in `.swiftlint.yml`; rules enforced manually
- **Architecture**: App shell + local Swift Package (all code in `Libraries/Package.swift`)
- **Concurrency**: MainActor default, approachable concurrency enabled

## Commands

```bash
# Build (iOS Simulator) — once Xcode project is created in Phase 1
xcodebuild -workspace VoiceTale.xcworkspace -scheme VoiceTale -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' build
```

## Cross-Repo

- **Portfolio patterns**: `../labsmith/Docs/PORTFOLIO_PATTERNS.md`
- **Portfolio rules**: `.claude/rules/` (synced from labsmith)

| Docs/DOCUMENT_CATALOG.md | pending | Self-referential doc index |

## Known Limitations

- **No Xcode project yet** — bootstrap only. Phase 1 implementation session creates the project per `labsmith/Docs/PORTFOLIO_PATTERNS.md` § Implementation Prep Checklist
- **No Question Kits yet** — labsmith authors `Resources/Questions/voicetale/kit_NN_*.json` in a future wave
- **No additional mascot poses** — only `encouraging` ships; remaining 4 (demonstrating, praising, thinking, working) generate in a future wave (~$1.08 cost ceiling per app)

## Workflow

This is a docs-only scaffold today. When the implementing CC session opens this repo:

1. Read `Docs/IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md` first
2. Read the labsmith concept doc at `labsmith/Docs/VoiceTale/README.md` for full vision
3. Follow the Implementation Prep Checklist in `labsmith/Docs/PORTFOLIO_PATTERNS.md` (Steps 3-7: create Xcode project, SPM package, stub files, build, begin Phase 1)
4. Author the pending Tier 2 docs as you go (or request labsmith to author them via a `Docs/HANDOFF_FROM_APP_TIER2_DOCS.md` request)
